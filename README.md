Utilities for working with Python Neural Networks

This is a Clojure port of the book [Neural Networks from Scratch in Python](https://nnfs.io/).
It uses the same MIT license as the source code from that book.

This is a naive attempt to work through the material, both to help me understand it and also to learn
Chris Nuernbergerâ€™s excellent [LibPython-CLJ](https://github.com/clj-python/libpython-clj) library. This
approach works better than [Neanderthal](https://github.com/uncomplicate/neanderthal)
as it is compatible with MacOS on Apple Silicon.
